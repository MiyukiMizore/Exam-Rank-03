Hello ! Here is a repositary about the Exam Rank 03

You must do ft_printf or get_next_line


1️⃣ ft_printf

1 expected file : ft_printf.c

Recreate printf, like the project in the cursus

You will only have to manage the "%s", "%d" and "%x"

2️⃣ get_next_line

2 expected file : get_next_line.c and get_next_line.h

Create get_next_line, a project in the cursus

The BUFFER_SIZE divided by BUFFER_SIZE technique does not work in exams anymore
